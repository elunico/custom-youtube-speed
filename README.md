# Custom YouTube Speed Extension

This extension is used to set a custom playback speed for YouTube videos outside of the default options given by YouTube. It has finer granularity and some other nice features. It is available for Firefox and Chrome. If you want to know more, please visit the respective extension (or add-on) pages from

The [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-youtube-speed/hjemikpikabiolgbpbdlgeccljdfdicf)

or [Mozilla Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-youtube-speed/)

or [The App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/custom-video-speed-for-youtube/id6443640011) for Safari. 

*Note that Apple, requires the Safari extension to come as part of an App Store App, the code for the App itself is the glue code generated by an Apple provided utility to convert a Web Extensions extension into an App Extension. The code for the App portion can be found [here](https://github.com/elunico/Custom-Video-Speed-For-YouTube-App-). The actual extension code is based on the Firefox code base in this repository and is **not** duplicated in the other repo*
