6.1.2 Update!
Changed icon and name to comply with guidelines.

6.0.0 UPDATE!

This is a breaking change. In an effort to make the extension work as closely as possible to how it was in 5.1.0 provided no options are changed, the following things were done
1. 'keypress' was changed to 'keydown' this due to how macOS reports codes in keypress. This should be transparent to the users
2. The options page no longer uses `keyCode` it now uses `key`. `keyCode` is deprecated and inconsistent between platforms and more opaque to use.
3. `event.preventDefault()` is now an option and no longer forced on. Not calling preventDefault() is the old behavior of 5.1.0 so this decision is so that the extension more closely works like 5.1.0 if no key bindings are changed


5.2.0 UPDATE!

NEW FEATURE: Change the keyboard shortcuts for the app! You can now change the keys that control the extension. Below (in the description) you can see the default keys used to control the extension. You can use the new options page to change which keys do what. There is also (though there has been for a while) the option to disable keyboard controls entirely if you prefer.

5.0.0 RECENTLY UPDATED!!! BUGS FIXED!! I noticed that when ads play it resets the speed the video. I have added a mechanism that ensures the speed is always moving at the current setting when the video is playing even after an ad interrupts it!!

5.0.2 Fixed issue with the grave key and added number formatting so there are no long decimal points

This extension lets you change the speed of YouTube™ videos in a more granular way than the default options in the player. The player on YouTube™ let's you change the speed to 0.25x, 0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2.0x the normal speed. This extension lets you change the speed of playback to between 0.1x to 8.0x normal speed by steps of 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, or 0.05.

Once you find a speed you like, you can also save it as the default speed which all YouTube™ videos will play at when opening.

You can also program up to 7 "preset speeds" that allow you to simply click a button and set the speed of the YouTube™ video to your stored preset.

By default this extension adds a the ability to control the speed of a YouTube™ video and some playback with keyboard shortcuts.

The '+' and '-' keys to change the speed by 0.1 and to the '*' and '/' keys change the speed in increments of 1.0.

If you hold shift while pressing these, '+' and '-' move in steps of 0.05 and '*' and '/' move in steps of 0.5.

It also assigns '`' to reset the speed to 1.0x normal speed.

Finally, it uses '[' and ']' to move through the video in time steps proportional to the speed of the video, rather than in increments of 5 or 10 seconds.

These shortcuts *can* be disabled on demand if you prefer not to have them and can be re-enabled at any time

I made this extension for fun and because it really made my YouTube™ experience better. I published it because I thought it might be useful for other people as well. I cannot promise every single YouTube™ page and video will work perfectly with this extension.  YouTube™ has a lot of places like gaming, educational playlists, livestreams, etc.

This extension is open source on GitHub (see website) link, and I am open to suggestions, issues, and fixes but I cannot make any promises about what I will do with those things if i receive them.
